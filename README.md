# CS492-Project
Twitter Algorithm Analysis Project for CS492

## Development

1. First create your twitter account
2. Put in your test account's username and password
3. Set the tag, which represents how you identify your data files (i.e demographic, profile, iteration, etc)
4. Create a new folder in the data folder with the tag name
5. Create a custom run function that includes code specific to your use case (i.e if the browser should close after script)
